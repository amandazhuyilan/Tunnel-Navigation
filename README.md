## Tunnel Navigation

My graduate robotics course joint-effort project to navigate vehicle through tunnels and areas of low GPS reception with the vehicle's built in acceleration and encoder, to give users accurate turn-by-turn directions.

## Tools and Resources
- Open source Navigation software that runs on multiple OS platforms: [Navit](https://github.com/navit-gps/navit)
- A Lincoln MKZ modified with a [Dataspeed ADAS package](http://dataspeedinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/adas-kit.pdf)
- [Sample ROS bag](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/9ef8c628fda9f5a5ab1a5441c202fe7b48ad64df/ROS_BAGS.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
