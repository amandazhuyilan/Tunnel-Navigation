To use the custom messages, follow these steps:
 
1. Edit javaclasspath.txt, add the following file locations as new lines, and save the file:
 
/home/vik748/dbw_msgs/matlab_gen/jar/dbw_mkz_msgs-1.0.4.jar
 
2. Add the custom message folder to the MATLAB path by executing:
 
addpath('/home/vik748/dbw_msgs/matlab_gen/msggen')
savepath
 
3. Restart MATLAB and verify that you can use the custom messages. 
   Type "rosmsg list" and ensure that the output contains the generated
   custom message types.
